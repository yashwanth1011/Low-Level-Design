## With Single Responsibility Principle VS Without Single Responsibility Principle

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), one of the core concepts of SOLID design principles. The SRP states that a class or function should have only one reason to change, meaning it should only have one responsibility.

### Structure

The Demonstration is organized into two main examples:

1.  **Without Single Responsibility**: A demonstration of code that violates the SRP by combining multiple responsibilities into a single class or function.
2.  **With Single Responsibility**: A refactored version that adheres to the SRP, where each class or function has only one responsibility.
